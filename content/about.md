# My name is Christos Panagiotakopoulos

I'm a self-proclaimed software craftsman with a 6-year experience in Node.js.

I'm currently building [Blogchain](https://blogchain.app) a decentralized discourse platform, as a Software Engineer, at [Capsule Social](https://capsule.social), while exploring the potential of the Decentralized Web.

In my free time, I play greek rembetiko music on the guitar and administer the [rembetiko.gr](https://rembetiko.gr) community.

From time to time you can read some of my thoughts, projects and ideas that I share on [my blog](/posts).

## Timeline

**2014:** I was admitted to the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens](https://ece.ntua.gr).

**2016:** Built ["When is my bus coming" ("Πότε έρχεται το λεωφορείο μου")](https://www.facebook.com/athensbus/), a Facebook chatbot that informed users of the estimated time of arrival of buses in Athens, Greece. At it's peak, it was serving over 20,000 weekly users.

**2017-2021:** Working at [Enneas](https://enneas.gr), a software house based in Athens, Greece. There, I designed from scratch their chatbot infrastructure and cooperated with big greek organisations such as Cosmote and OPAP to produce innovative software solutions.

**2021-Now:** Working at [Capsule Social](https://capsule.social) as Lead Backend Engineer. We released [Blogchain](https://blogchain.app), a decentralised, censorship resistant, blogging platform where articles are stored on IPFS.

**2022:** Moved to Paris, France.
