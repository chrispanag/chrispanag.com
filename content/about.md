# My name is Christos Panagiotakopoulos

I’m a software engineer specializing in backend services. I work with Go and NodeJS to build systems that support millions of users. I enjoy creating efficient, scalable solutions that ensure everything runs smoothly at scale.

In my free time, I play greek rembetiko music on the guitar and administer the [rembetiko.gr](https://rembetiko.gr) community.

From time to time you can read some of my thoughts, projects and ideas that I share on [my blog](/posts).

## Timeline
