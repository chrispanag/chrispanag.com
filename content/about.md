# My name is Christos Panagiotakopoulos

I'm a self-proclaimed software craftsman with a 6-year experience in Node.js.

In my free time, I play greek rembetiko music on the guitar and administer the [rembetiko.gr](https://rembetiko.gr) community.

From time to time you can read some of my thoughts, projects and ideas that I share on [my blog](/posts).

## Timeline

**2014:** I was admitted to the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens](https://ece.ntua.gr).

**2016:** Built ["When is my bus coming" ("Πότε έρχεται το λεωφορείο μου")](https://www.facebook.com/athensbus/), a Facebook chatbot that informed users of the estimated time of arrival of buses in Athens, Greece. At it's peak, it was serving over 20,000 weekly users.

**Sep 2017 - Jul 2021:** Working at [Enneas](https://enneas.gr), a software house based in Athens, Greece. There, I designed from scratch their chatbot infrastructure and cooperated with big greek organisations such as Cosmote and OPAP to produce innovative software solutions.

**Aug 2021 - Feb 2023:** Working at Capsule Social as Lead Backend Engineer. We released Blogchain, a decentralised, censorship resistant, blogging platform where articles are stored on IPFS.

**Feb 2022:** Moved to Paris, France.

**Mar 2023:** Built [Paroles.gr](https://paroles.gr), a web app built on NestJS, React, Postgresql and Typescript that allows users to easily search the lyrics of greek songs.
